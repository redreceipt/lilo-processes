#Screens & Projectors
We use 3 screens and projectors each weekend and we want to keep each one in the same location each week.  Each screen has 2 cases  - a longer black case that has the screen frame, bolts and curtains and a shorter black case that contains the leg structures and the actual screeen mat. 

1. Screen 1, Projector 1, and Genie Lift 1 are located on the stage right floor of the cafeteria. Screen 1 is ground supported using the leg structures located in the smaller black case.
2. Screen 2, Projector 2, and Genie Lift 2 are located on the the center of the stage. Screen 2 is supported by 1 10' sections of truss
3. Screen 3, Projector 3, and Genie Lift 3 are located on the stage left floor of the cafeteria. Screen 3 is ground supported using the leg structures located in the smaller black case.

###Setting Up Projectors
####Projector Settings
Each week we need to check the color temperature and aspect ratios of each projector. They should be set as the following:

Color Temperature: 6500k  
Aspect Ratio: 16:9
###Breaking Down Projectors
Our projectors need to be cooled down each week before we disconnect them from power.

1. Lower the projector. 
2. Put the projector into standby mode by holding the "STBY" button for 2 seconds 
3. Wait for the projector to cool off by disconnecting and rolling up the HDSDI Cable. This gets rolled up and put into the appopriate drawer in the video workbox. After you roll up the HDSDI you can come back to the projector and filp off the power switch on the back of the projector. 
4. Remove the front panel.
5. Inside the projector is a little black button at the top of the lens to relase the lens lock. Press this and then rotate the lens clockwise to relase it.
6. Attach lens cap to front and back of lens.
7. Replace front panel of projector and add cap.
8. Carefully place the lens in the center compartment of the projector road case, and and power cable to other compartment.
