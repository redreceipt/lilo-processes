##Power Distro &amp; Feeder
Our Power distro lives on stage in the up stage right corner of the stage next to the audio amp rack and the audio wireless rack. There is a 50' 3-Phase feeder loom that lives in the black FOH Snake caddy. The female end of the feeder loom plugs into the power disconnect that is installed on the side wall in the little theatre and the male end of the feeder plugs into the power distro.

**IMPORTANT** - When connecting and disconnecing feeder, ground and neutral (green and white) are *ALWAYS* the first to get plugged in and last to get unplugged.

##Stage Box Power
There are three boxes that provide power to the stage. 

1. Orange Box is located downstage center and provides power for teleprompt tv and the acoustic pedal board. The orange 5pin twist-lock cable runs from the power distro to the orange box.
2. Red Box is located on stage right behind lighting truss tower 2 and the screen. This box provides power for the keyboard, rhythm guitarist and lighting on stage right. The red 5pin twist-lock cable runs from the power distro to the red box.
3. Purple Box is  located on stage left behind the lighting truss tower 3 and the screen. This box provides power for the dummer, lead guitarist, and lighting on stage left. The purple 5pin twist-lock cable runs from the output on the red box behind the center screen and into the purple box.
